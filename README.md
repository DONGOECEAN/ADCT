## Code of Abutting Grating Distortion
The code to generate Abutting Grating Distortion can be found in "utils/abutting_grating_illusions.py"

## Visualize samples of AG-MNIST, high-resolution AG-MNIST, AG-silhouette
The following files generate samples of AG distortion
AG-MNIST : 1_visualize_mnist28.py
high-resolution AG-MNIST : 2_visualize_mnist224.py
The code for training, validation, and testing the model is located at: AMP_train_val_test_dp.py
